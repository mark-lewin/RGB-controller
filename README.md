# RGB-controller
Custom 16-channel aRGB controller for two 6-channel Lian Li Strimer Plus cables and 4 VDG headers

It's made to control two 6-channel strimer cables (ATX and PCIe 3 x 8 cables) or one 6-channel and one 4-channel strimer (PCIe 2 x 8 cable).
Silkscreen on the board is to tell you what pin numbers you need to program.
It fits in a 2.5" SSD footprint
The bill of materials is in BOM.ods. There is no schematic. It was a simple enough circuit to design without one.
BOM does not include the 4 threaded standoffs needed for mounting in 2.5" SSD bays
